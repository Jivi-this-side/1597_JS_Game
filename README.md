~ The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the  sum of the two numbers before it.


The sequence starts with 0 and 1

The second number is 1

The third number is 1 + 0 = 1

The fourth number is 1 + 1 = 2

The fifth number is 2 + 1 = 3

The sixth number is 3 + 2 = 5

And so on..........
